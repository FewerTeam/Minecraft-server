            If this error isn't normal, create an issue on GitHub.
            Reason of the crash :
            This method doesn't be coded.
        At:
            - Server/classes/server.py
                \_ Server().generate()
            Post error action : stopping the server (FATAL ERROR, EXIT CODE -1)
            This error isn't an enormous error, in this case the server will be stopped without warning and logs.
            --> An antecedent maybe created the error.
            IS THE SERVER MODED ? Maybe not, this version isn't a base-modified version. If you modified the server, 
            The PythoninMinecraft organisation can't do anything.
